              <p>Gojira is a French metal band from Ondres, close to Bayonne in the South West of France. Formed in 1996, the band was known as Godzilla until 2001. 
              Gojira is composed of Joe Duplantier on vocals and rhythm guitar, his brother Mario Duplantier on drums, Christian Andreu on lead guitar, and Jean-Michel Labadie on bass. 
              Gojira has written five studio albums and produced three live DVDs. 
              They are known for their environmentally-themed lyrics and have gone from "utmost obscurity" to being mentioned regularly "amongst the genre's leading new millennium upstarts", according to <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gojira-mn0000721409">Allmusic</a></p>

              <p>Opeth is a Swedish progressive metal band from Stockholm, formed in 1990. 
              Though the group has been through several personnel changes, singer, guitarist, and songwriter Mikael Ã…kerfeldt has remained Opeth's driving force throughout the years. 
              Opeth has consistently incorporated progressive, folk, blues, classical and jazz influences into their usually lengthy compositions, as well as strong influences from black metal and death metal, especially in their early works. Many songs include acoustic guitar passages and strong dynamic shifts, as well as both death growls and clean vocals. 
              Opeth rarely made live appearances supporting their first four albums; but since conducting their first world tour after the 2001 release of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackwater_Park">Blackwater Park</a>, they have led several major world tours.</p>

            <h2><strong>Drums</strong></h2>
            <p>From <a href ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum">Wiki</a></p>
            <p> The <strong>drum</strong> is a member of the percussion group of musical instruments. In the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system, it is a membranophone.[1] Drums consist of at least one membrane, called a drumhead or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the player's hands, or with a drum stick, to produce sound. There is usually a resonance head on the underside of the drum, typically tuned to a slightly lower pitch than the top drumhead. Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll. Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years.[1]
            Drums may be played individually, with the player using a single drum, and some drums such as the djembe are almost always played in this way. Others are normally played in a set of two or more, all played by the one player, such as bongo drums and timpani. A number of different drums together with cymbals form the basic modern drum kit.</p>
