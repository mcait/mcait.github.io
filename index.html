            <p>Gojira is a French metal band from Ondres, close to Bayonne in the South West of France. Formed in 1996, the band was known as Godzilla until 2001. Gojira is composed of Joe Duplantier on vocals and rhythm guitar, his brother Mario Duplantier on drums, Christian Andreu on lead guitar, and Jean-Michel Labadie on bass. Gojira has written five studio albums and produced three live DVDs. They are known for their environmentally-themed lyrics and have gone from "utmost obscurity" to being mentioned regularly "amongst the genre's leading new millennium upstarts", according to Allmusic</p>

            <p>Opeth is a Swedish progressive metal band from Stockholm, formed in 1990. Though the group has been through several personnel changes, singer, guitarist, and songwriter Mikael Ã…kerfeldt has remained Opeth's driving force throughout the years. Opeth has consistently incorporated progressive, folk, blues, classical and jazz influences into their usually lengthy compositions, as well as strong influences from black metal and death metal, especially in their early works. Many songs include acoustic guitar passages and strong dynamic shifts, as well as both death growls and clean vocals. Opeth rarely made live appearances supporting their first four albums; but since conducting their first world tour after the 2001 release of Blackwater Park, they have led several major world tours.</p>
